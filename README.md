## Welcome to Emmett
Glad you're here!

I like building stuff. I used to specialize in systems programming, but now I'm just obsessed with products. I don't care how it's built, I just want to build stuff people want to use. If that means if I have to build using:
- 🐹 Go
- 👨🏻‍💻 Nikola (the blogging framework)
- 🔧 A wrench

... then so be it!

Feel free to email me about anything.
